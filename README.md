Interview "work simulation"
==========

This repository contains an implemented solution of the "work simulation" project.  There are several 
questions that could have been asked upfront such as :

<UL>
<LI>What JDK would you like to use?
<LI>Do you want a build file created?  If so, what is your tool of choice (maven/gradle/ant/shell scripts..no judging!)
<LI>What is the intention of (x) -- I'll save that for our discussion
</UL>


If you truly are excited by the project - you can listen to me as I write the code.  When possible, I do try to use
design pattern (GoF) but in the spirit of the project, not going to go overboard.  It's important to write maintanable
code, and using patterns is a great way to do this.  It also helps less experienced or developers new to the codebase 
come up to speed quicker (and facilitates discussions between developers).

To summarize - balance.  Ask questions, get done what we are asked, do it in a timeframe that enables us
to iterate on our solution (if possible).  Make the customer happy.


Thank you for the opportunity

Side Note:
I wrote in my email that I did try to commit the branch -- You did say to fork it :)
